**AI-Powered Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Transportation Infrastructure**

## Overview

This project presents a novel methodology for assessing climate vulnerabilities in transportation infrastructure using Google's Satellite Embedding dataset and AlphaEarth Foundations AI model. The approach leverages 64-dimensional AI-learned features to identify climate-related changes in critical infrastructure and generate data-driven adaptation strategies.

The analysis demonstrates the first application of Google's Satellite Embedding dataset to transportation infrastructure assessment, providing a scalable framework for proactive climate resilience planning.

## Project Significance

Climate change poses increasing risks to transportation infrastructure worldwide. Traditional assessment methods rely on historical data and reactive approaches. This project introduces a paradigm shift toward predictive, AI-powered infrastructure vulnerability assessment using satellite-derived intelligence.

The methodology enables transportation planners and climate adaptation specialists to identify at-risk infrastructure before failures occur, optimize adaptation investments, and develop targeted resilience strategies based on empirical satellite observations.
